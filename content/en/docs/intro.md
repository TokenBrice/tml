Lien Finance is a novel protocol enabling the creation of a unique type of derivatives on ETH: bond tokens.

Lien is a flexible and elegant system that could support a various range of use cases. Lien's team is anonymous, yet confident the protocol can quickly provide value. To demonstrate it, they decided to tackle, as a first use case, a previously unsolved challenge: providing a trustless and scalable stablecoin on the Ethereum network: iDOL (Independent Dollar).

### Limitations of Existing Stablecoins

The protocols already existing & tackling similar use cases, such as Maker (DAI) or Synthetix (sUSD) suffer significant drawbacks. Lien Finance is an elegant system attempting to overcome the current limitation faced by such systems:

1. **Reduced economic efficiency** Overcollateralization greatly reduces the economic efficiencty of a given system, making it ultimately unable to suffice at scale. 
2. **Trustlessness erosion**: as the Maker system scales, the trustlessness erodes. Currently, 20% of the collateral involved in the Maker system are trusted assets (wBTC & USDC) which can be seized or frozen.
3. **Inefficient governance**: the governance of such systems is an expert game of parameter-tuning. It tends to exclude users without significant technical expertise from the governance process.

### Achieving Scalable Trustlessness

The design of the Lien system provides an elegant answer to these three main issues:

1. **With Lien/iDOL, over-collateralization is not necessary.** Instead, the base unit of the system is not ETH, but two derivatives created from it - Solid Bond Tokens and Liquid Bond Tokens.
2. Lien was built by an anonymous team unwilling to compromise. ETH, an asset offering credible trustless economic bandwidth is the only input of the system.
3. **Lien is a self-regulating protocol**. Decisions related to parameter tuning are taken automatically by smart contracts adjusting to market conditions. Hurray! The community can focus on actual governance.
